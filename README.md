# Word pictures

Some graphics I put together quickly to illustrate a point that some games involve word intersections. I didn't think much about this, just that I drew a grid and put some letters in boxes. The Addition version uses my customdice package, and honestly I'm not sure why the Scrabble tiles aren't drawn the same way! Perhaps because the number isn't strictly a subscript?

This was for a livestream of the [Finite Group](http://finitegroup.co.uk/). Since then, I changed the Scrabble tiles to have rounded corners and fixed a missing clue number on the crossword grid.
